Hi Everyone,

I’m a website developer.

I am committed, focused and prioritize on achieving your business goals. In a previous life, 
I was a salesman, a marketer, a financial and operating director, an entrepreneur. 
So I have a unique point of view on website creation that other developers do not possess.

You can see my skills in the "Skills" section above.

I can offer you the following service for your sites:
✓ prepare a design layout;
✓ prepare texts, pictures, mount video;
✓ prepare HTML/CSS/JS code ;
✓ adapting for different screen sizes and devices;
✓ hosting on servers in the Internet;
✓ convert HTML/CSS/JS to a Wordpress Theme;
✓ make site on the Tilda constructor;
✓ integrate your site and CRM Bitrix24 ...

✓ I’m also designing projects for turnkey, from start to finish.

I’m always striving to improve and grow my skills to become a complete front-end and 
back-end developer.

With respect,

Sergio
